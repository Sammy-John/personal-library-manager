# Business Case — Personal Library Manager

## 1. Problem Statement

For avid readers and book collectors, keeping track of their personal library can become increasingly difficult. The user often forgets which books they own, where they left off in a particular book, or what they thought about it. Generic tools like spreadsheets or note-taking apps do not offer the depth or visual clarity required for effective book tracking, nor do they allow for personalized workflows or categorization.

## 2. Motivation

This project arises from a personal need to organize a growing personal book collection in a way that aligns with individual reading habits. Unlike existing tools or commercial book-tracking apps, the goal here is to build a custom, user-centric solution — one that is clean, minimal, and tailored to the exact preferences of the user.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

The core goals of the Personal Library Manager are:

- Maintain a personal database of all owned books
- Track reading history and progress for each book
- Add personal notes, thoughts, or quotes from specific parts of a book
- Categorize books by genre, tags, or custom fields
- Schedule or set reminders for planned reading sessions

Secondary goals include:

- Serve as a portfolio-quality software development project
- Create a foundation that could be scaled into a public-facing or shareable app
- Experiment with clean architecture, UI/UX design, and WPF capabilities

## 4. Benefits

Compared to traditional methods like spreadsheets, online lists, or third-party apps, this solution offers:

- A **customizable system** designed around the user’s actual reading behavior
- A **visually pleasing UI** with desktop-first design considerations
- A **centralized space** for personal thoughts, reviews, and book-based journaling
- The ability to iterate, extend, and scale the project for new features

## 5. Stakeholders

Currently, the project is designed for **a single user** — the developer — to meet personal needs and learning goals. However, it may provide future value to:

- Readers with large book collections
- Busy individuals who struggle to maintain a reading habit
- Other developers or readers seeking customizable library tools

## 6. Success Criteria

The minimum viable product (MVP) for version 1.0 will be considered successful when it supports the following:

- Display a detailed list of all personal books
- Allow users to comment on and annotate each book
- Track last read date and current progress in any book
- Enable scheduling or tracking of future reading sessions

## 7. Intended Use and Outcome

The initial build is intended for **personal use** and to serve as a **portfolio piece** demonstrating clean architecture, layered design, and design pattern usage in a WPF application. Once complete, the app may be shared publicly or further enhanced based on community feedback or extended personal needs.
