# Target Users — Personal Library Manager

## 1. Primary User

The initial target user for the Personal Library Manager is the developer themself — a technically proficient individual who enjoys reading and seeks a custom solution for managing their personal book collection.

## 2. User Needs and Habits

The target user often encounters the following challenges:

- Forgets which books have already been read or where they left off
- Struggles to recall specific thoughts or reflections on books previously finished
- Wants to maintain consistent reading habits but often loses momentum
- Wishes to track reading progress and schedule sessions for better accountability

## 3. Key Priorities

Users of the system are expected to prioritize:

- **Ease of Use** — the interface should be intuitive and reduce friction in entering or browsing data
- **Visual Appeal & UX** — the design must support clear information hierarchy and enjoyable interaction
- **Customizability** — the system should feel tailored to the user's unique reading style and preferences

## 4. Technical Expectations

While the primary user is technical and able to understand the underlying architecture, the system is designed to eventually support a wider audience. These future users are likely to be **non-technical** readers who prefer simplicity and reliability over configuration or complexity.

## 5. Broader Audience Potential

Though starting as a personal tool, the project may be extended into a **niche product for book lovers**, casual readers, or collectors who want a more customizable and user-friendly alternative to mainstream apps. As the app evolves, user roles and new personas may be defined to expand its utility.
