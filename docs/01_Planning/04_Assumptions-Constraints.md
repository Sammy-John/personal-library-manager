# Assumptions and Constraints â€” Personal Library Manager

## âœ… Assumptions

The following assumptions are made during the planning and development of this project:

1. **Development Environment**  
   The developer has access to the necessary tools and environment, including Visual Studio, GitHub, and Windows OS, and can dedicate focused time to build the project over a short period (1â€“2 days of active development).

2. **User Platform**  
   The application will be run on a Windows-based system with .NET installed. There is no requirement for cross-platform compatibility or mobile support.

3. **Scope of Data**  
   The book collection being managed is relatively small (under 100 entries), so performance concerns related to large-scale datasets are minimal.

## ðŸš§ Constraints

The project will operate under the following constraints:

1. **Technology Stack**  
   - The application must use **WPF (.NET 8)** as the frontend framework.
   - Data storage will be handled via **local JSON files** only in the initial version.
   - No use of external APIs, cloud storage, or third-party services for MVP.

2. **Platform Limitation**  
   - The application is limited to **Windows desktop environments** only.
   - It will not support mobile, tablet, or web deployment at this stage.

3. **Open Timeline**  
   - The project is open-ended with no fixed deadline, but will be scoped to deliver a viable MVP suitable for personal use and portfolio demonstration.
